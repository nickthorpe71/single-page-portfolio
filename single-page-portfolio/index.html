                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Nick Thorpe. I'm a hard working and versatile developer located is Chicago, IL. My
                    background is in game development and I am currently working on web projects.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="about">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Since 2015 I have been programming and loving every moment of it. What started with a desire to
                    create my
                    own games to share with friends has evolved into a passion for building software that is interesting
                    and
                    innovative. Most of my online presence as a developer has been thorugh Lost One Studios which can be
                    found on both <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lostonestudios/?hl=en"
                        target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lostonestudios?lang=en"
                        target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
                    I recently launched a turn based strategy PvP game in the mobile market called Alchamancer which has
                    hundreds of downloads. I am currently attending the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"
                        target="_blank">Thinkful coding bootcamp</a> to expand my skills
                    in web development and ultimately find a great team that I can commit to and work with to deliver
                    amazing products. </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of programmig I also love playing music and exercising, currently on a calisthenics kick.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some of the projects I am most proud of.</p>

                    <p>Created to allow players to quickly play a strategic spell casting game against each other online
                        from their
                        phone. I used Unity and C# to build the game and used PUN2 for the networking. The
                        game appears simple but through creating it I learned the importance of having strong management
                        systems in place to help organize and optimize.</p>

                    <p>This project is a simple version of snake that I created to learn more about JavaScript. It is a
                        project I plan to keep building on and testing ideas with. So far I have learned about using
                        multiple JS objects and haveing those scripts interract with eachother. </p>

                    <p>This game was created with a team called Ming Wyrm Games. Our team consisted of 2 artists, one
                        musician and 2 programmers. We were able to complete the project in just over a month. Pushing
                        for this deadline taught me a lot about how to manage time and focus on the MVP.</p>
